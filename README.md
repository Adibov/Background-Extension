# Background-Extension
My first chrome extension, learned through official documentation. You can read the documentation via [this link](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/).

To test the functionality of the extenstion, first clone the project and then load it as an unpacked extension in chrome. After that the extention will be added to your extentions list. The extention change the background color of the current page, also you can change the default color under options page.

# Some Motivation :))
It takes only about 1~2 hours to understand the requirement concepts and ~~copy~~ implement them.
